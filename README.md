# How to get Started :
- clone the repo
- (inside your cloned repo type this cmd)npm i (to install node dependecies)
- make a folder called config with a file called .env => config/.env

  (the /env file contains the the API tokens needed so you'll have to get them).
  
  Your .env file should look like something like this : 

    > D_TOKEN= 'DISCORD bot token'

    > OpenWheather_TOKEN= 'OpenWeatherMap API'

    (Note : remove the space between '=' and your API/token and make sure you don't include these '')
- (inside your cloned repo type this cmd)npm start (to run your bot)
